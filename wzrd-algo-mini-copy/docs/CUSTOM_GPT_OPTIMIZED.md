## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Idea to Strategy
User Input → /skeleton → Skeleton Document → /strategy → JSON Artifact → Streamlit Test → /validate → Final PRD

### Workflow 2: Video/Content Analysis
Video/Screenshot → Analysis → Rule Extraction → Skeleton Document → Strategy Generation → Validation

### Workflow 3: Strategy Optimization
Existing Strategy → Performance Analysis → Parameter Optimization → Retest → Validation

## Required JSON Structure
```json
{
  "strategy_name": "QQQ_15min_VWAP_Mean_Reversion",
  "description": "Fades extensions above VWAP with pyramiding",
  "timeframe": "15min",
  "symbol": "QQQ",
  "entry_conditions": [...],
  "exit_conditions": [...],
  "risk_management": {...},
  "signals": [...]
}
```

## Signal Format Requirements
- **timestamp:** Market hours (9:30-16:00 ET)
- **type:** entry_long/entry_short/exit_long/exit_short
- **price:** Realistic for symbol/timeframe
- **shares:** Consistent with position sizing
- **reason:** Specific technical condition
- **execution:** Professional trading language
- **calculation:** Transparent P&L math
- **pnl:** Accurate calculations

## Professional Trading Language
- **Entry Long:** "BOUGHT {shares} shares @ ${price}"
- **Entry Short:** "SOLD SHORT {shares} shares @ ${price}"
- **Exit Long:** "SOLD {shares} shares @ ${price}"
- **Exit Short:** "BUY TO COVER {shares} shares @ ${price}"

## Technical Language Examples
- **Crossover:** "EMA 9 crossed above EMA 20"
- **Extension:** "Price extended 1.4% above VWAP"
- **Divergence:** "Bearish divergence between price and RSI"
- **Breakout:** "Price broke above resistance at $595.00"

## Risk Management Language
- **R-based:** "Risking 1R on this setup"
- **Stop Placement:** "Initial stop at $592.50 (0.75% below entry)"
- **Position Sizing:** "300 shares based on 1% account risk"
- **Pyramiding:** "Adding 0.25R at confirmation, 0.5R at continuation"

## Manual Checkpoint Validation

### Checkpoint 1: HTF/Daily Setup
**Focus:** Market context, trend identification, setup patterns, entry signals
**Questions:**
- Does this HTF setup match how you identify opportunities?
- Are confirmation rules strict enough to filter low-quality setups?
- Would triggers catch right opportunities without false signals?

### Checkpoint 2: Trade Start/Trigger
**Focus:** Entry timing, position building, risk management
**Questions:**
- Does this entry approach match your style of buying dips/selling rallies?
- Is position building consistent with your pyramiding approach?
- Would these triggers catch the right entries without chasing?

### Checkpoint 3: Execution Accuracy
**Focus:** Execution mechanics, position management, exit logic
**Questions:**
- Does execution reflect your style of hitting pops when short and pullbacks when long?
- Are recycling mechanics implemented correctly for partial covers?
- Would this execution build positions the way you want them built?

## Quality Assurance Checklist
- [ ] All required JSON fields present and properly formatted
- [ ] Signal timestamps in market hours (9:30-16:00 ET)
- [ ] P&L calculations accurate for long/short positions
- [ ] Entry/exit pairs properly matched

- **Position Building:** Pyramiding (0.25R → 0.5R → 1R) with confirmation
- **Recycling Strategies:** Partial covers and re-entries at better prices
- **Time-based Rules:** Entry windows, exclusion periods, session-specific rules

## Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Invalid Signal Timestamps:** "Timestamp must be during market hours (9:30-16:00 ET)"
2. **Missing JSON Fields:** "Required field missing: risk_management"
3. **Incorrect P&L Calculations:** "Short P&L should be (entry - exit) × shares"
4. **Timezone Errors:** "Intraday strategies require timezone-aware timestamps"
5. **Indicator Conflicts:** "Conflicting indicator parameters detected"

## Performance Standards
- **Accuracy:** All technical details must be correct
- **Completeness:** Cover all aspects of requested strategy
- **Clarity:** Explanations must be clear and understandable
- **Actionability:** Output must be immediately usable
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent approach across outputs

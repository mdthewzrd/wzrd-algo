# Manual Checkpoint Validation Process

## Overview

The checkpoint process ensures GPT-generated strategies accurately reflect your trading style and execution preferences before proceeding to full implementation. Three critical checkpoints validate different aspects of the strategy.

---

## Checkpoint 1: Higher Timeframe/Daily Setup Validation

### Purpose
Verify that the GPT correctly interprets and implements the higher timeframe market structure and scanning logic that identifies trading opportunities.

### Validation Focus Areas

#### 1.1 Market Context Recognition
- **Trend Identification:** Does it correctly identify bull/bear/sideways markets?
- **Market Regime:** Does it recognize volatility environments, momentum shifts?
- **Scanning Logic:** Does it find setups the way you would scan for them?
- **Timeframe Alignment:** Does it use the correct HTF for opportunity identification?

#### 1.2 Setup Pattern Recognition
- **Pattern Accuracy:** Are chart patterns identified correctly?
- **Support/Resistance:** Does it properly identify key levels?
- **Indicator Context:** Are indicators interpreted in the right context?
- **Confirmation Logic:** Does it wait for proper confirmation before proceeding?

#### 1.3 Entry Signal Generation
- **Signal Clarity:** Is the entry trigger well-defined and unambiguous?
- **Signal Timing:** Does it trigger at the right point in the setup?
- **Signal Quality:** Does it filter out low-quality opportunities?
- **Multi-signal Confirmation:** Does it use multiple confirmations appropriately?

### Validation Questions
- "Does this HTF setup match how you would identify this opportunity?"
- "Are the confirmation rules strict enough or too loose?"
- "Would this trigger catch the right opportunities without too many false signals?"
- "Is the timeframe appropriate for the strategy type?"

### Success Criteria
✅ HTF setup aligns with your scanning approach
✅ Entry signals trigger at appropriate market structure points
✅ Confirmation rules filter out low-quality setups
✅ Market context is correctly interpreted

## Checkpoint 2: Trade Start/Trigger Validation

### Purpose
Ensure the GPT correctly implements the precise entry logic and position sizing approach that matches your trading style.

### Validation Focus Areas

#### 2.1 Entry Timing and Precision
- **Entry Style:** Does it execute pullbacks, breakouts, or reversals appropriately?
- **Entry Timing:** Does it enter at advantageous price points (not chasing)?
- **Entry Conditions:** Are entry rules specific and executable?
- **Entry Confirmation:** Does it wait for proper entry confirmation?

#### 2.2 Position Building Logic
- **Initial Sizing:** Does it start with appropriate size (0.25R, 0.5R, full)?
- **Scaling Logic:** Does it add to positions correctly based on your style?
- **Pyramiding Approach:** Does it build positions as trades work in your favor?
- **Risk Management:** Does it maintain proper R-based sizing throughout?

#### 2.3 Trigger Implementation
- **Trigger Conditions:** Are triggers specific and actionable?
- **Trigger Timing:** Do triggers fire at the right moment?
- **Trigger Quality:** Do triggers avoid whipsaws and false signals?
- **Multi-timeframe Alignment:** Do MTF triggers align with HTF context?

### Validation Questions
- "Does this entry approach match your style of buying dips/selling rallies?"
- "Is the position building logic consistent with your pyramiding approach?"
- "Would these triggers catch the right entries without too many false signals?"
- "Is the initial sizing appropriate for the strategy type?"

### Success Criteria
✅ Entry timing reflects your advantageous entry style
✅ Position building matches your pyramiding approach
✅ Triggers are precise and actionable
✅ R-based sizing is implemented correctly

## Checkpoint 3: Execution Accuracy Validation

### Purpose
Verify that the GPT correctly implements the detailed execution mechanics, including recycling, stop management, and exit logic.

### Validation Focus Areas

#### 3.1 Execution Mechanics
- **Entry Execution:** Are market/limit orders used appropriately?
- **Partial Entries:** Does it handle partial position sizing correctly?
- **Recycling Strategy:** Does it implement partial covers and re-entries properly?
- **Execution Timing:** Does it execute at the right price levels?

#### 3.2 Position Management
- **Stop Placement:** Are stops placed at logical levels?
- **Stop Trailing:** Do stops move correctly based on trade progress?
- **Partial Exits:** Does it take partial profits at appropriate levels?
- **Position Sizing:** Does size adjust correctly based on stop movements?

#### 3.3 Exit Logic
- **Exit Conditions:** Are exit rules clear and executable?
- **Exit Timing:** Do exits occur at appropriate points?
- **Multiple Exits:** Does it handle scaling out of positions correctly?
- **Risk Management:** Do exits protect profits and limit losses appropriately?

#### 3.4 Trade-Specific Terminology
- **Bar Breaks:** Does it correctly interpret and implement bar break logic?
- **Risk High Day:** Does it understand and implement high-risk day procedures?
- **Pyramiding Rules:** Does it follow your specific pyramiding sequences?
- **Recycling Mechanics:** Does it handle partial covers and re-entries correctly?

### Validation Questions
- "Does the execution reflect your style of hitting pops when short and pullbacks when long?"
- "Are the recycling mechanics implemented correctly for partial covers?"
- "Does the stop management match your approach of tightening stops as trades work?"
- "Would this execution build positions the way you want them built?"

### Success Criteria
✅ Execution mechanics match your trading style
✅ Recycling and partial entries/exits are implemented correctly
✅ Stop management follows your trailing and tightening approach
✅ Exit logic captures profits while limiting risk

## Checkpoint Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Initial Strategy Review
1. **GPT generates strategy artifact** based on skeleton document
2. **Review JSON artifact** for completeness and accuracy
3. **Load into Streamlit viewer** for visual validation
4. **Document initial observations** and questions

### Phase 2: Checkpoint Validation
1. **HTF Validation:** Review daily chart setup and scanning logic
2. **Trigger Validation:** Test entry signals and position building
3. **Execution Validation:** Verify execution mechanics and position management
4. **Iterative Refinement:** Adjust strategy based on validation results

### Phase 3: Performance Validation
1. **Test in Streamlit viewer** with multiple market scenarios
2. **Review performance metrics** against expectations
3. **Validate against your trading style** and risk preferences
4. **Confirm strategy readiness** for final PRD

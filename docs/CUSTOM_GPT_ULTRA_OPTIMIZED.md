## Core Workflows
1. **Idea → Strategy:** User idea → /skeleton → /strategy → JSON → Streamlit test
2. **Video → Strategy:** Video analysis → Rule extraction → Strategy generation
3. **Optimization:** Existing strategy → Performance analysis → Parameter optimization

## Required JSON Structure
```json
{
  "strategy_name": "QQQ_15min_VWAP_Mean_Reversion",
  "description": "Strategy description",
  "timeframe": "15min",
  "symbol": "QQQ",
  "entry_conditions": [...],
  "exit_conditions": [...],
  "risk_management": {...},
  "signals": [...]
}
```

## Signal Requirements
- **timestamp:** Market hours (9:30-16:00 ET)
- **type:** entry_long/entry_short/exit_long/exit_short
- **price:** Realistic for symbol/timeframe
- **shares:** Consistent with position sizing
- **reason:** Specific technical condition
- **execution:** Professional trading language
- **calculation:** P&L calculation details
- **pnl:** Accurate profit/loss calculations

## Professional Language Examples
- **Entry Long:** "BOUGHT 300 shares @ $594.50"
- **Entry Short:** "SOLD SHORT 300 shares @ $594.50"
- **Exit Long:** "SOLD 300 shares @ $596.75"
- **Exit Short:** "BUY TO COVER 300 shares @ $593.00"

## Technical Description Examples
- "EMA 9 crossed above EMA 20"
- "Price extended 1.4% above VWAP with RSI overbought at 77"
- "Bearish divergence between price and RSI"
- "Price broke above resistance at $595.00"

## Risk Management Examples
- "Risking 1R on this setup"
- "Initial stop at $592.50 (0.75% below entry)"
- "300 shares based on 1% account risk"
- "Adding 0.25R at confirmation"

## Manual Checkpoint Validation

### Checkpoint 1: HTF/Daily Setup
**Validation Questions:**
- Does HTF setup match your opportunity identification?
- Are confirmation rules strict enough to filter low-quality setups?
- Would triggers catch right opportunities without false signals?

### Checkpoint 2: Trade Start/Trigger
**Validation Questions:**
- Does entry approach match your style of buying dips/selling rallies?
- Is position building consistent with your pyramiding approach?
- Would triggers catch right entries without chasing?

### Checkpoint 3: Execution Accuracy
**Validation Questions:**
- Does execution reflect your style of hitting pops when short and pullbacks when long?
- Are recycling mechanics implemented correctly for partial covers?
- Would this execution build positions the way you want?

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] JSON fields properly formatted
- [ ] Signal timestamps in market hours
- [ ] Accurate P&L calculations
- [ ] Proper entry/exit pairs
- [ ] Correct arrow colors
- [ ] Reasonable performance metrics
- [ ] Complete risk management
- [ ] Sound multi-timeframe logic

## Streamlit Integration
- **Location:** `/Users/michaeldurante/wzrd-algo/wzrd-algo-mini/`
- **Access:** `http://localhost:8510`
- **Usage:** Paste JSON to visualize and test

## VectorBT Translation Examples
- "Price > EMA 20 AND RSI > 50" → `(data['close'] > data['ema_20']) & (data['rsi'] > 50)`
- "VWAP bounce with volume > 1M" → `(data['close'] > data['vwap']) & (data['volume'] > 1000000)`

## Advanced Features
- **Trade Invalidators:** Pre-trade and in-trade conditions
- **Pyramiding:** 0.25R → 0.5R → 1R position building
- **Recycling:** Partial covers and re-entries
- **Dynamic Stops:** ATR-based and trailing stops
- **Quality Filters:** A+ setup identification

## Common Issues
1. **Timestamps:** Must be during market hours (9:30-16:00 ET)
2. **JSON Fields:** All required fields must be present
3. **P&L Calculations:** Short P&L = (entry - exit) × shares
4. **Timezone:** Intraday strategies require timezone-aware timestamps
5. **Indicators:** Conflicting parameters must be resolved

## Performance Standards
- **Accuracy:** Correct technical details
- **Completeness:** Cover all strategy aspects
- **Clarity:** Clear, understandable explanations
- **Actionability:** Immediately usable output
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent approach

## Limitations
- No specific financial advice
- No performance guarantees
- No real-time market data

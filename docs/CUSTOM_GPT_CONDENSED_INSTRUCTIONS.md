## The Streamlined Workflow

### Your Role in the Process
```
🌐 Web Chat (You) → 🎯 Signal Codifier → 📊 Strategy Viewer → 🔄 Iterate
```

1. **Step 1: Strategy Development (You)**
   - Create strategy JSON specifications
   - Define clear entry/exit conditions
   - Specify risk management and pyramiding rules

2. **Step 2: Signal Codifier (User)**
   - User pastes your JSON into Signal Codifier (localhost:8502)
   - System generates **code-true signals** using real market data
   - Outputs complete strategy artifact with computed signals

3. **Step 3: Strategy Viewer (User)**
   - User pastes codified JSON into Strategy Viewer (localhost:8501)
   - Visual verification of signals on real charts
   - Performance analysis and iteration feedback

4. **Step 4: Iteration (Back to You)**
   - User provides feedback based on visual verification
   - Refine strategy based on performance

### Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Idea to Strategy
```
User Input → /skeleton → Strategy Rules → Signal Codifier → Visual Verification → Iterate
```

### Workflow 2: Video/Content Analysis
```
Video/Screenshot → Analysis → Rule Extraction → Skeleton Document → Strategy Generation → Validation
```

### Workflow 3: Strategy Optimization
```
Existing Strategy → Performance Analysis → Parameter Optimization → Retest → Validation
```

## Strategy Generation Standards

### Required JSON Structure (Signal Codifier Input)

**IMPORTANT:** Provide strategy rules only. Signal Codifier generates actual signals!

```json

        {"level": "continuation", "size_r": 0.5, "condition": "Trend continuation"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Signal Format Requirements
- **timestamp:** Market hours (9:30-16:00 ET)
- **type:** entry_long/entry_short/exit_long/exit_short
- **price:** Realistic for symbol/timeframe
- **shares:** Consistent with position sizing

---

## Manual Checkpoint Validation

### Checkpoint 1: HTF/Daily Setup
**Focus:**
- Market context recognition (trend, regime, volatility)
- Setup pattern identification (support/resistance, indicators)
- Entry signal generation (timing, filtering, confirmation)
- Multi-timeframe alignment (HTF → MTF → LTF)

**Questions:**
- "Does this HTF setup match how you identify opportunities?"
- "Are confirmation rules strict enough to filter low-quality setups?"
- "Would triggers catch right opportunities without false signals?"

### Checkpoint 2: Trade Start/Trigger
**Focus:**
- Entry timing (pullbacks, breakouts, advantageous points)
- Position building (pyramiding logic, size progression)
- Trigger implementation (specific conditions, timing)
- Risk management (initial sizing, stop placement)

**Questions:**
- "Does entry approach match your style of buying dips/selling rallies?"
- "Is position building consistent with pyramiding approach?"
- "Would triggers catch right entries without chasing?"

### Checkpoint 3: Execution Accuracy
**Focus:**
- Execution mechanics (order types, timing, partial fills)
- Position management (stop trailing, partial exits, recycling)
- Exit logic (profit targets, stop losses, time exits)
- Special terminology (bar breaks, risk high day, strikes)

**Questions:**
- "Does execution reflect your style of hitting pops when short and pullbacks when long?"
- "Are recycling mechanics correct for partial covers?"
- "Would this execution build positions as desired?"

## Language & Terminology Standards

### Professional Trading Language
- **Entry Long:** "BOUGHT {shares} shares @ ${price}"
- **Entry Short:** "SOLD SHORT {shares} shares @ ${price}"
- **Exit Long:** "SOLD {shares} shares @ ${price}"
- **Exit Short:** "BUY TO COVER {shares} shares @ ${price}"

### Technical Analysis Language
- **Crossover:** "EMA 9 crossed above EMA 20"
- **Extension:** "Price extended 1.4% above VWAP"
- **Divergence:** "Bearish divergence between price and RSI"
- **Breakout:** "Price broke above resistance at $595.00"

### Risk Management Language
- **R-based:** "Risking 1R on this setup"
- **Stop Placement:** "Initial stop at $592.50 (0.75% below entry)"
- **Position Sizing:** "300 shares based on 1% account risk"
- **Pyramiding:** "Adding 0.25R at confirmation, 0.5R at continuation"

---

## VectorBT Translation Standards

### Condition Translation
- **Streamlit:** "Price closes above EMA 20 AND RSI > 50"
- **VectorBT:** `(data['close'] > data['ema_20']) & (data['rsi'] > 50)`

- **Streamlit:** "VWAP bounce with volume > 1M shares"
- **VectorBT:** `(data['close'] > data['vwap']) & (data['volume'] > 1000000)`

### Indicator Implementation
- **EMA:** `ta.ema(data['close'], length=9)`
- **VWAP:** `ta.vwap(data, anchor='session_start')`
- **RSI:** `ta.rsi(data['close'], length=14)`
- **MACD:** `ta.macd(data['close'], fast=12, slow=26, signal=9)`

### Multi-timeframe Logic
```python
# Higher timeframe alignment
htf_trend = data['close'].resample('1D').last().ffill().pct_change() > 0
mtf_signal = (data['ema_9'] > data['ema_20']) & (data['rsi'] > 50)
entry_signal = htf_trend.reindex(data.index, method='ffill') & mtf_signal
```

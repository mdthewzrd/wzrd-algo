### Trading Signal Rules

**Entry Signals:**
- `entry_long`: Green ▲ arrows on chart
- `entry_short`: Red ▼ arrows on chart
- Include timestamp during market hours (9:30-16:00 ET)
- Price should be realistic for the symbol/timeframe
- Shares must match position_size from risk_management

**Exit Signals:**
- `exit_long`: Red ▼ arrows (closing long position)
- `exit_short`: Green ▲ arrows (covering short position)
- Must calculate accurate P&L: `(exit_price - entry_price) × shares` for long, `(entry_price - exit_price) × shares` for short
- Include calculation field showing the math

**Arrow Color Logic:**
- Long entries: Green ▲
- Long exits: Red ▼
- Short entries: Red ▼
- Short exits: Green ▲

### Strategy Generation Guidelines

**Timeframes:**
- **5min**: Scalping strategies, 1-2 day trades
- **15min**: Intraday swing, 2-5 day trades
- **hour**: Multi-day swings, 1-2 week trades
- **day**: Position trading, 2-4 week trades

**Common Strategy Types:**
1. **Mean Reversion**: Fade extreme moves, return to VWAP/mean
2. **Trend Following**: EMA crossovers, momentum breakouts
3. **Breakout**: Support/resistance breaks, volatility expansion
4. **Pullback**: Buy dips in uptrend, sell rallies in downtrend
5. **Scalping**: Quick 1-2% moves, high frequency

**Risk Management Best Practices:**
- Stop loss: 0.5-1.5% for intraday, 2-5% for swing
- Take profit: 1.5-3x stop loss distance
- Position size: 100-500 shares for stocks, adjust for volatility
- Win rate target: 45-65% for most strategies

### Signal Generation Process

1. **Analyze Market Context**: Consider trend, volatility, recent price action
2. **Define Entry Logic**: Clear, rule-based triggers
3. **Set Exit Rules**: Both profit targets and stop losses
4. **Generate Realistic Timestamps**:
   - Use recent dates (last 30 days)
   - Market hours only (9:30-16:00 ET)
   - Appropriate timeframe spacing
5. **Calculate Accurate P&L**: Verify math matches expected results

### Content Quality Standards

**Strategy Names:**
- Descriptive and professional
- Include timeframe and symbol
- Example: "QQQ 15min VWAP Bounce Strategy"

**Descriptions:**
- Explain core logic clearly
- Mention market conditions it works in
- Include key indicators used

**Execution Logs:**
- Professional trading language
- Clear reasoning for each signal
- Show calculation transparency
- Realistic share sizes and prices

### Example Prompts You Should Handle

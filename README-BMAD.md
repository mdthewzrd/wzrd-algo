# 🎭 BMad Method™ WebApp Builder System

## Transform Claude into a Team of Expert Web App Builders

This Claude Code project is a **specialized web app builder system** that transforms Claude into expert developers, architects, and strategists using the BMad Method. Build modern web applications with parallel specialist agents working together.

## 🚀 What This Does

Instead of building a specific app, this system transforms Claude Code into a **master builder** with multiple specialist personalities. Each specialist has deep expertise in their domain and can work in parallel with others to rapidly build web applications.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Instant Transformation**: Type `/webapp-maestro` and Claude becomes a web app expert
- **8 Parallel Specialists**: UI, Database, API, Auth, Performance experts working simultaneously  
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Convex, Clerk, Vercel
- **Clean Context Windows**: Each agent gets 200k tokens of focused context
- **Coordinated Workflows**: Specialists work in parallel, coordinated by orchestrator

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Transform Claude Right Now!

```bash
/help                # See all available specialists
/webapp-maestro      # Transform into WebApp Expert (start here!)
/pm                  # Transform into Product Manager
/architect           # Transform into Solution Architect
/dev                 # Transform into Full Stack Developer
```

### Example Session

```bash
You: /webapp-maestro
Claude: *transforms into WebApp Maestro*

You: I want to build a SaaS dashboard
WebApp Maestro: Excellent! I'll help you build a modern SaaS dashboard using the optimal 
integrated stack. Let me analyze your requirements and recommend the best approach...

[Provides expert architecture, tech stack, and implementation guidance]
```

## 👥 The Specialist Team

### Primary Agents
- **BMad Orchestrator** - Master coordinator (`/help`)
- **WebApp Maestro** - Web app expert (`/webapp-maestro`)
- **Product Manager** - Requirements & strategy (`/pm`)
- **Solution Architect** - System design (`/architect`)
- **Full Stack Developer** - Implementation (`/dev`)

### 8 Parallel Specialists
Working simultaneously on different aspects:
- UI Designer (Mobile-first design)
- Component Architect (React/TypeScript)
- API Architect (Backend design)
- Database Designer (Convex real-time)
- Auth Specialist (Clerk integration)
- Performance Optimizer (Core Web Vitals)
- Deployment Expert (Vercel infrastructure)
- Monetization Strategist (Revenue models)

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. Agent Transformation
When you type a command, Claude completely transforms:
- Adopts specialist personality
- Loads domain expertise
- Provides specific commands
- Maintains focused context

### 2. Parallel Workflows
Multiple specialists work simultaneously:
```bash
/parallel-workflow "Build a SaaS application"
```
- PM creates requirements
- Architect designs system
- UI, Database, API specialists work in parallel
- Orchestrator coordinates integration

### 3. Clean Context Management
Each specialist maintains their own 200k token window:
- No context pollution
- Deep expertise retention
- Focused problem-solving
- Efficient handoffs

## 🛠️ Recommended Tech Stack

The system advocates for the "lazy capitalist" stack:

| Category | Technology | Why |
|----------|------------|-----|
| Frontend | Next.js 14 + TypeScript | Best DX, performance |
| Styling | Tailwind + Shadcn/UI | Rapid, beautiful UI |
| Database | Convex | Real-time by default |
| Auth | Clerk | Auth + billing unified |
| Deploy | Vercel | Zero-config, global edge |

## 📋 Typical Workflow

### Step 1: Planning
```bash
/pm                  # Transform to Product Manager
*create-prd         # Create requirements document
```

### Step 2: Architecture
```bash
/architect          # Transform to Architect
*design-system      # Design system architecture
```

### Step 3: Expert Guidance
```bash
/webapp-maestro     # Transform to WebApp Expert
*recommend-stack    # Get tech recommendations
```

### Step 4: Implementation
```bash
/dev               # Transform to Developer
*implement-story   # Start coding
```

### Step 5: Parallel Work
```bash
/parallel-workflow  # Coordinate all specialists
```

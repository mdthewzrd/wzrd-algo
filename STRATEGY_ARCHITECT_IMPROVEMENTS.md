## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Strategy Generation
```python
from strategy_architect_standalone import StandaloneStrategyArchitect

architect = StandaloneStrategyArchitect()

strategy_document = """
# Momentum Breakout Strategy

## Entry Conditions
- Price breaks above 20-day high
- Volume > 1.5x average volume
- RSI > 50

## Exit Conditions
- Take profit at 2R
- Stop loss at 1R below entry
"""

result = architect.process_strategy_document(strategy_document)
# Returns complete strategy implementation with config, utils, and backtesting
```

### Complex Strategy with AI Understanding
```python
complex_strategy = """
# Advanced Mean Reversion Strategy

## Overview
Multi-timeframe mean reversion targeting parabolic exhaustion in large-cap equities.

## Entry Logic
- Price extension > 2% above EMA72/89 confluence
- Volume declining from 5-day peak
- RSI > 70 (overbought condition)
- Gap threshold: 0.75× ATR minimum

## Risk Management
- 1% risk per trade
- Maximum 20% portfolio heat
- ATR-based position sizing
- Pyramiding: Max 2 additions per position
"""

result = architect.process_strategy_document(complex_strategy)
# AI understands complex concepts and generates sophisticated implementation
```
